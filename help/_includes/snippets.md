## Take a practice test {#practice-test}

We recommend taking the free practice test before you start. You'll have unrestricted access to all available practice tests for Adobe's expert-level exams.

Our practice tests are all developed from the same blueprint as the live exams. The practice test will help you understand the topics covered in the live exam.

Please remember that passing a practice test does not guarantee you will pass the certification exam.

Go to the [Adobe Certification Exam Prep Portal](https://www.certmetrics.com/adobe/candidate/gmetrix_sso.aspx){target="_blank"} now to take a practice test.
