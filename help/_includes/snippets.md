## Take a practice test {#practice-test}

We recommend taking the free practice test before you start. You'll have unrestricted access to all available practice tests for Adobe's expert-level exams.

Our practice tests are all developed from the same blueprint as the live exams. The practice test will help you understand the topics covered in the live exam.

Please remember that passing a practice test does not guarantee you will pass the certification exam.

Go to the [Adobe Certification Exam Prep Portal](https://www.certmetrics.com/adobe/candidate/gmetrix_sso.aspx){target="_blank"} now to take a practice test.

## About the certification exam {#about-certification-exam}

Adobe uses two vendors to administer proctored exams, PSI and [!DNL Examity]. 

* **PSI** offers test center and Japanese exam options (where available) 
* **[!DNL Examity]** offers a remote online option

To schedule, reschedule, or cancel your exam, simply select the vendor of choice, and follow the instructions provided on screen. It's that simple!

Cancellations and rescheduling are possible if initiated prior to 48 hours before the scheduled exam appointment. Candidates must modify this appointment themselves.

Pay for your certification exam either by voucher or credit card. To purchase an exam voucher go to: [Adobe Certification Voucher Center](https://market.xvoucher.com/adobe/global){target="_blank"}. You can apply the voucher code when you schedule your exam. If you have a discount, it will apply at checkout.

## PSI note {#PSI-note}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Beginning August 1, 2023, exam scheduling will no longer be available with PSI. If you have already scheduled an exam with PSI, you must take it before August 1, 2023. If you have scheduled an exam with PSI after August 1, 2023, please reschedule your exam to take place before that date. If you are not able or not prepared to take your exam before August 1, 2023, please email <certif@adobe.edu> so that we can support you transferring your exam to Examity. This includes Japanese-language exams.
