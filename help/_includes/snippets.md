## Create your account {#create-your-account}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Government ID required:** You MUST use a government-issued photo ID as your valid form of ID. Soft copies or digital IDs are not allowed. <br><br> **Adobe ID account name:** Your Adobe ID account name MUST match your name on your government ID. To update your Adobe ID account name, e-mail <certif@adobe.com>. Please request this correction **72 hours in advance**. If the names do not match at the time of the exam, you will need to sign up for a new exam at an additional charge.

You must have an Adobe ID to schedule and take your exam. If you do not have an Adobe ID, you can create one [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/create-update-adobe-id.html).

It is necessary to have an Adobe ID for three reasons:

* You will need an Adobe ID to create and log in to your [Adobe Credential Management System](https://www.certmetrics.com/adobe){target="_blank"} account. This is where you can view your certifications, exam history, exam scores, and additional information.
* You must be logged in to the Adobe Credential Management System in order to create and log in to your Examity account. That is where you will schedule, pay for, and take your test.
* You must be logged in to the Adobe Credential Management System to take practice tests on the Adobe Certification Exam Prep Portal.

## Study Materials {#study-materials-intro}

You are not required to complete training before taking the exam, and training alone will not provide you with the knowledge and skills required to pass the exam. A combination of training and successful, on-the-job experience are critical to providing you with the repository needed to pass the exam.

Here are some suggested resources to help you prepare:

## Sample questions {#sample-questions}

The sample questions allow you to see the type and format of items that you will encounter in the actual exam. There is no sign-on needed. The results of the sample questions are not stored, and do not predict your actual test results.

<!--divider-->

## Take a practice test {#practice-test}

We recommend taking the free practice test before you start. You'll have unrestricted access to all available practice tests for Adobe's expert-level exams.

Our practice tests are all developed from the same blueprint as the live exams. The practice test will help you understand the topics covered in the live exam.

Please remember that passing a practice test does not guarantee you will pass the certification exam.

To take the practice test:

1. First, log in to the [Adobe Credential Management System](https://www.certmetrics.com/adobe){target="_blank"} with your Adobe ID.

2. Then, go to the [Adobe Certification Exam Prep Portal](https://www.certmetrics.com/adobe/candidate/gmetrix_sso.aspx){target="_blank"} to find your practice test.
