## Take a Practice Test

We are excited to offer free practice tests and provide a detailed coaching report upon completion of each one. You will have unlimited access to all available practice tests for Adobeâ€™s expert-level exams. Our practice tests are developed from the same blueprints as the live exams, so they can help you gauge how you are doing in each topic area. However, taking a practice test does not guarantee that you will pass the certification exam.

Go to the Adobe [Credential Management System](https://www.certmetrics.com/adobe/) to launch a practice test.
