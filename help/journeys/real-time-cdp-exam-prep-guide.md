## Recommended training

You are not required to complete training before taking the exam; however, training can significantly increase your knowledge and skills on Adobe Experience Platform and Adobe Real-Time CDP. It is important to note that training alone will not provide you with the knowledge and skills required to pass an exam. Successful, on-the-job-experience is critical to providing you the knowledge needed to pass the exam.

For partners, training options are available in the [Partner learner journeys](https://solutionpartners.adobe.com/content/dam/spp_assets/public/public_4/Partner_Learner_Journey.pdf) via the Adobe Solution Partner Program portal.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q**: What if I pass only one of the required exam (AD0-E600 or AD7-E601), will I get any certificate, badge or a logo?
