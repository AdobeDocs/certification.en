## 3. Take the exam

To earn certification, you need to pass 2 distinct exams with a proctor present, online or on-site, where available.

Purchase your exam voucher at <a href="https://market.xvoucher.com/adobe">Adobe Certification Voucher Center</a>, which will apply your partner discount at checkout. Apply the voucher code when you schedule your exam.

If an exam is marked as Retiring, you can still take it and your certification will be valid for two years from when you pass. We recommend taking the newer version, when possible, because it covers newer product capabilities. .
