# Renew your certification {#renew}

To maintain your Adobe certification, you must renew it every 24 months. Failing to renew your certification within the specified time-frame will result in its expiration, and you will need to take the full certification exam again to become re-certified. 

To avoid any disruptions to your certification status, please keep track of your certification renewal date and ensure that you complete the renewal process before the expiration date.

## How do I renew my certification?
