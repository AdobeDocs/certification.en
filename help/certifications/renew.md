# Renew your certification {#renew}

To maintain your Adobe certification, you must renew it every 24 months. Failing to renew your certification within the specified time-frame will result in its expiration, and you will need to take the full certification exam again to become re-certified. 

To avoid any disruptions to your certification status, please keep track of your certification renewal date and ensure that you complete the renewal process before the expiration date. 

See your current and expired certifications under the certifications tab, in the [Adobe Credential Management system](https://www.certmetrics.com/adobe/candidate/cert_summary.aspx){target="_blank"}.

## How do I renew my certification?
