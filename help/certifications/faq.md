+++WHAT IS CERTIFICATION AND WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS?

Individual benefits: Certification is a credential that recognizes an individual's skill and competency in an Adobe application. A candidate who passes the certification exam becomes an Adobe Certified Professional, Expert, or Master.  

Certifications require commitment, are legally defensible, and validation from Adobe of your expertise. You can also feature your certification on your social profiles by downloading your badge from Credly.

+++

+++HOW DO I KNOW WHICH EXAM TO TAKE? 

Certifications are role-based, which means there are multiple exams available. Review the exam guides on the certification page to choose which exam to take. You will choose the exam by:

* Application: for example, Adobe Analytics or Marketo Engage 
* Role: for example, developer or business practitioner 
* Level: for example, Professional, 0-12 months of experience; or Expert 1-3 years 

Sometimes there are multiple versions of an exam. A current exam won't have any labels, but you might see either retiring or renewal: 

* Retiring means that this exam version will soon be removed because a new version of the exam is available. We encourage candidates to take the most recent version, but you can take the retiring version if you feel more prepared to take it. Either way, your certification will last for two years.  
* Renewal exams renew your existing certification for two years, have fewer questions, and are lower cost. These exams cover more recent application capabilities. You must take the renewal exam before your certification expires. Once your existing certification expires, then you'll have to take the regular certification exam.

+++

+++IF I DON'T PASS THE CERTIFICATION EXAM, WHEN CAN I TRY AGAIN?

ou will need to retake and pass the most recent certification exam to get or maintain your Adobe Certified status. Please plan to take the test in more than enough time to account for potential retakes before your certification expires. 

If a candidate fails on their first attempt to pass any Adobe certification exam, the candidate must wait at least 24 hours before retaking the exam. Failure to pass an exam on the second or any subsequent attempt requires a waiting period of 14 calendar days before retaking the exam. Each attempt will incur a separate exam fee.

+++

+++ARE EXAMS AVAILABLE IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH?

+++DO YOU OFFER CERTIFICATIONS AT ADOBE EVENTS? 

Certifications are offered at certain Adobe‐sponsored events. 

+++

+++ARE CERTIFICATIONS TIED TO SPECIFIC VERSIONS OF APPLICATIONS (E.G. ADOBE EXPERIENCE MANAGER 6.5)? 

Not directly, no. But because certification will now require renewal every 2 years, your certification ensures that you remain current on the latest version of an Adobe application. 

+++

>[!TAB Renewals via on-demand exams]

+++WHAT IS CERTIFICATION RENEWAL? HOW DO I RENEW MY CERTIFICATION? 

Adobe certifications expire after two years. You can renew your certification by taking and passing the latest version of the applicable Adobe certification exam. If a new exam is not available, your certification will be extended until the new exam is available. 

You have two options: 

* Take the regular certification exam 
* Take the renewal exam—a shorter exam that focuses on the newest solution capabilities as well as the things you already know.  

You can't take a renewal exam if you don't have the original certification or if your certification has expired. 

Occasionally, we retire an exam for a role. In that case, your certification will last for two years, then that certification will expire. For example, we no longer offer the Lead/Dev Ops certification, so that certification will expire without a replacement exam.

+++

+++WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON'T RENEW MY CERTIFICATION RENEWAL BEFORE IT EXPIRES? 

Your certification will expire and will show as expired in Credly and any of your social profiles. Also, if your certification expires, then you can't take the shorter renewal exam or renew via continuous learning.

+++

+++WHAT IS THE COST TO RENEW MY CERTIFICATION? 

You can renew your certification free of charge. This provides you with a cost-effective way to maintain your certification, and keep your solution skills up to date.

To learn more about How to Renew Your Certification, go [here](https://experienceleague.corp.adobe.com/docs/certification/certification/renew.html?lang=en){target="_blank"}.

+++

+++WHERE CAN I SEE MY CERTIFICATION EXPIRATION DATE?  WILL I GET AN EXPIRATION NOTICE? 

Sign in to [Adobe Credential Management System](https://www.certmetrics.com/adobe/){target="_blank"}. There you can see when you achieved your credential and when it will expire. You should also check your profile and confirm that your contact, secondary email and job information are correct. 

You will get an email notification one month before your certification expires. But if you have changed jobs and haven't updated your email then you might not get notified. Add a secondary email (such as Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc.) in your CertMetrics account, so that you get a certification expiration reminder email, even if you change companies.

To find out what exam you will need to take, log in to the [Adobe Credential Management System](https://www.certmetrics.com/adobe/){target="_blank"} using your Adobe ID, click Certifications, and select the certification name. The renewal exam is listed under **requirement to stay current**.
