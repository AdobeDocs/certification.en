# Renew your [!DNL Adobe Target] certification

When you pass a certification exam, your certification is valid for two years.

We're happy to announce that you are now able to renew your certification via a new, no-cost format. It involves using on-demand Adobe Experience League courses and tutorials--simply complete three activities to renew your certification at no cost. You must renew before your certification expires, or you will need to take the full exam to become certified again.

You should be currently certified (not expired) in:

* [!DNL Adobe Target] Business Practitioner Expert
* [!DNL Adobe Target] Architect Master

## Instructions for renewing your [!DNL Adobe Target] certification

Select **three activities** to complete and pass the course assessments associated with each.

* **Step 1**: Successfully log in to [Adobe Credential Management System](http://www.certmetrics.com/adobe){target="_blank"}, then return to this page
* **Step 2**: Study the courses in Experience League
* **Step 3**: Complete and pass each course assessment with at least 80%

Alternatively, study two courses, pass two course assessments and submit a customer reference form validating your engagement in a project totaling 100 hours in the past 12 months.

For certain Adobe Experience Cloud certifications, the Adobe Credential Program accepts **customer references** that validate your continued work as an Adobe certified individual leading, managing and/or participating on an Adobe Experience Cloud implementation project.

In these cases you can provide a customer reference affirming you have participated in at least 100 hours of demonstrated project engagement during your certification renewal 2-year interval.

**Once your customer reference has been reviewed you will be notified by the Adobe Credential Team.**

The course assessments are free. There is no need to schedule them, and they are not proctored. If you hold multiple Adobe Experience Manager Expert and Master level certifications, you will only need to complete the requirements below and all your AEM certifications will get renewed.
