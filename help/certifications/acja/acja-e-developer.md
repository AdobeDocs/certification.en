You are not required to complete training before taking the exam, and training alone will not provide you with the knowledge and skills required to pass the exam. A combination of training and successful, on-the-job experience are critical to providing you with the repository needed to pass the exam.

Here are some suggested resources to help you prepare:

**Take a practice test**

We recommend taking the free practice test before you start. You'll have unrestricted access to all available practice tests for Adobe's expert-level exams.

Our practice tests are all developed from the same blueprint as the live exams. The practice test will help you understand the topics covered in the live exam.

Please remember that passing a practice test does not guarantee you will pass the certification exam.

Go to the [Adobe Certification Exam Prep Portal](https://www.certmetrics.com/adobe/candidate/gmetrix_sso.aspx){target="_blank"} now to take a practice test.

* **PSI** offers test center and Japanese exam options (where available)
