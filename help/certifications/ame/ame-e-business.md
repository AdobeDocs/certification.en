**Take a practice test**

We recommend taking the free practice test before you start. You'll have unrestricted access to all available practice tests for Adobe's expert-level exams.

Our practice tests are all developed from the same blueprint as the live exams. The practice test will help you understand the topics covered in the live exam.

Please remember that passing a practice test does not guarantee you will pass the certification exam.

Go to the [Adobe Certification Exam Prep Portal](https://www.certmetrics.com/adobe/candidate/gmetrix_sso.aspx){target="_blank"} now to take a practice test.

**Take the certification exam**

Adobe uses two vendors to administer proctored exams, PSI and Examity. 

* **PSI** offers test center and Japanese exam options (where available) 
* **[!DNL Examity]** offers a remote online option

To schedule, reschedule, or cancel your exam, simply click on the vendor of choice, and follow the instructions provided on screen. It’s that simple! 

Your profile name in the Adobe Credential Management System must exactly match your Government ID. Failure to have identical information or any mismatch will result in the proctor terminating the exam and will require you to reschedule your appointment in addition to paying an additional exam fee.

Cancellations and rescheduling are possible if initiated prior to 48 hours before the scheduled exam appointment. Candidates must modify this appointment themselves.
