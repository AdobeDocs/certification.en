# Certification journey - Adobe Campaign renewal

## Start your journey toward renewing your certification

When you pass a certification exam, your certification is valid for two years.

We're happy to announce that you're now able to renew your certification via a new, no-cost format. Say goodbye to scheduling your examâ€”these new on-demand exams will allow you to take your exam wherever and whenever you'd like, as long as you take it before your current certification expires. 

You must renew your certification before your certification expires, otherwise, you will need to take the full exam to become certified again. Renewal exams are meant only for those who have an existing credential that is about to expire.

If you are currently certified (not expired) in:

* Adobe Campaign Classic Developer expert
* Adobe Campaign Classic Business Practitioner expert
* Adobe Campaign Classic Architect master

...this is the renewal path for YOU!
