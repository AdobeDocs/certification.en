**Take the certification exam**

Adobe uses two vendors to administer proctored exams, PSI and Examity.

To schedule, reschedule, or cancel your exam, simply click on the vendor of choice, and follow the instructions provided on screen. It’s that simple! 

Your profile name in the Adobe Credential Management System must exactly match your Government ID. Failure to have identical information or any mismatch will result in the proctor terminating the exam and will require you to reschedule your appointment in addition to paying an additional exam fee.

Cancellations and rescheduling are possible if initiated prior to 48 hours before the scheduled exam appointment. Candidates must modify this appointment themselves.
