>[!TAB Taking your exam]

Your [profile](https://www.certmetrics.com/adobe/candidate/demographics.aspx){target="_blank"} name in the Adobe Credential Management System must exactly match your Government ID. Failure to have identical information or any mismatch will result in the proctor terminating the exam and will require you to reschedule your appointment in addition to paying an additional exam fee. 

Cancellations and rescheduling are possible if initiated prior to 48 hours before the scheduled exam appointment. Candidates must modify this appointment themselves.  

Neither Adobe Support or exam vendors can process rescheduling and cancellation requests. Cancellations under 48 hours are subject to a rescheduling fee in addition to the exam fee. 

 Once you complete an exam, you receive a provisional pass or fail. The final score can take up to 72 hours to populate. You will find your result and score report under the History tab in the [Adobe Credential Manager](http://www.certmetrics.com/adobe){target="_blank"}.  

 If you fail to pass an Adobe certification exam on your first attempt, you must wait at least 24 hours before retaking the exam. Failure to pass an exam on the second or any subsequent attempt requires a waiting period of 14 calendar days before retaking the exam. Each attempt will incur a separate exam fee. 

>[!TAB Exams costs]

These are the current costs for certification exams.

* Credit card: All major credit cards accepted. 
* Xwallet: This will subtract the order amount from your Xwallet pool. 

+++

+++Is there a minimum or maximum number of vouchers I can purchase?

No, there is no minimum or maximum. Customer purchases are only limited based on available funds, such as a credit card limit or bank account balance for wire transfers.
