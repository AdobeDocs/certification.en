**Start your journey toward renewing your certification**

When you pass a certification exam, your certification is valid for two years.

We're happy to announce that you are now able to renew your certification via a new, no-cost format. It involves using on-demand Adobe Experience League courses and tutorialsâ€”simply complete three activities to renew your certification at no cost. You must renew before your certification expires, or you will need to take the full exam to become certified again. 

You should be currently certified (not expired) in:

* Adobe Experience Manager Assets Developer expert
* Adobe Experience Manager Dev/Ops Engineer expert
* Adobe Experience Manager Forms Developer expert
* Adobe Experience Manager Sites Developer expert
* Adobe Experience Manager Sites Business Practitioner expert
* Adobe Experience Manager Architect master

>Adobe Certified Professional renewal **(coming soon)**!

>[!BEGINTABS]

>[!TAB Get ready]

To renew your currently active certifications, select three Adobe Experience League courses from the list below, review them, and pass the related course assessment listed in the Credential Management System. Alternatively, pass two assessments and submit a customer reference form validating your engagement in a project totaling 100 hours in the past 12 months.

These course assessments are free. There is no need to schedule them, and they are not proctored. If you hold multiple Adobe Experience Manager Expert and Master level certifications, you will only need to complete the requirements below and all your AEM certifications will get renewed.

>[!TAB Get prepped & renew your certification]

Select **three activities** (course assessments or customer reference) to complete. Study the courses in Experience League. Then log in and pass the course assessments from the Adobe Credential Management System. 

Refer to the "renew your certification" section below to redirect to the Adobe Credential Managment System for the course assessments after competing your course.

For certain Adobe Experience Cloud certifications, the Adobe Credential Program accepts customer references that validate your continued work as an Adobe certified individual leading, managing and/or participating on an Adobe Experience Cloud implementation project.

You are required to provide a customer reference affirming you have participated in at least 100 hours of demonstrated project engagement during your certification renewal 2-year interval.
