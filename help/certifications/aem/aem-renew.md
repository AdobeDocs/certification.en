![Certification Expert Badge](/help/certifications/assets/expert-badge-Xsmall.png) ![Certification Master Badge](/help/certifications/assets/master-badge-Xsmall.png) 

**Start your journey toward renewing your certification**

When you pass a certification exam, your certification is valid for two years.

We're happy to announce that you are now able to renew your certification via a new, no-cost format. It involves using on-demand Adobe Experience League courses and tutorialsâ€”simply complete three activities to renew your certification at no cost. You must renew before your certification expires, or you will need to take the full exam to become certified again. 

You should be currently certified (not expired) in:

* Adobe Experience Manager Sites Developer expert
* Adobe Experience Manager Sites Business Practitioner expert
* Adobe Experience Manager Sites Architect master
* Adobe Experience Manager Assets Developer expert
* Adobe Experience Manager Dev/Ops Engineer expert
* Adobe Experience Manager Forms Developer expert

>[!TAB Expert and Master]

**How to renew your certification:**

Select **three activities** to complete and pass the course assessments associated with each.

* **Step 1** - Study the courses in Experience League.
* **Step 2** - Complete the course assessment 

Alternatively, study two courses, pass two course assessments and submit a customer reference form validating your engagement in a project totaling 100 hours in the past 12 months.

For certain Adobe Experience Cloud certifications, the Adobe Credential Program accepts **customer references** that validate your continued work as an Adobe certified individual leading, managing and/or participating on an Adobe Experience Cloud implementation project.

In these cases you can provide a customer reference affirming you have participated in at least 100 hours of demonstrated project engagement during your certification renewal 2-year interval.

**Once your customer reference has been reviewed you will be notified by the Adobe Credential Team.**

>IMPORTANT NOTE: The following section and links will **only** function after a **successful login** to the [Adobe Credential Management System](http://www.certmetrics.com/adobe){target="_blank"}. 

**Now that you have successfully logged in, the following links will be directly accessible.**

The course assessments are free. There is no need to schedule them, and they are not proctored. If you hold multiple Adobe Experience Manager Expert and Master level certifications, you will only need to complete the requirements below and all your AEM certifications will get renewed.
