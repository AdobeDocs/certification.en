# Certification journey - Adobe Experience Manager renewal

## Start your journey toward renewing your certification

Your certification is valid for two years from when you pass. We recommend taking the newer version, when possible, because it covers newer product capabilities. You also have the option of renewing your current certification before it expires.

We're happy to announce that you are now able to renew your certification via a new, no-cost format. It involves using on-demand Adobe Experience League courses and tutorialsâ€”simply complete three activities to renew your certification at no cost. You must renew your certification before your certification expires, otherwise, you will need to take the full exam to become certified again. 

If you are currently certified (not expired) in:

* Adobe Experience Manager Expert (in Assets Developer
* Dev/Ops Engineer
* Forms Developer, Sites Developer and Sites Business Practitioner
* Adobe Experience Manager Master

This is the renewal path for YOU!

## Get ready

To renew your currently active certifications, select three Adobe Experience League courses from the list below, review them, and pass the related course assessment listed in the Credential Management System. Alternatively, pass two assessments and submit a customer reference form validating your engagement in a project totaling 100 hours in the past 12 months.

These course assessments are free. There is no need to schedule them, and they are not proctored. If you hold multiple Adobe Experience Manager Expert and Master level certifications, you will only need to complete the requirements below and all your AEM certifications will get renewed.
