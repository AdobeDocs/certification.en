# Certification Journey - Adobe Analytics {#aa-get-ready}

## Start Your Journey toward Certification

To earn certification, you need to pass 2 distinct exams with a proctor present, online or on-site, where available.

Purchase your exam voucher at Adobe Certification Voucher Center, if you have a discount, it will apply at checkout. Apply the voucher code when you schedule your exam.

If an exam is marked as retiring, you can still take it and your certification will be valid for two years from when you pass. We recommend taking the newer version, when possible, because it covers newer product capabilities.

If you have technical knowledge about audience segmentation, destination exports, and activation on real time basis for unified profiles that adhere to data and privacy regulations, customer data platforms (CDP) and knowledge of Adobe Experience Platform. 

This is the certification for YOU!
