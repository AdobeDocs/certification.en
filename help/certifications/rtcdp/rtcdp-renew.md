# Renew your Adobe [!DNL Real-Time CDP] certification

Your Adobe certification is valid for two years. If you are nearing this two-year mark, it's time to renew your certification to keep it active. 

First, select the appropriate level on the tab below (Professional, Expert, or Master). Then carefully review what you'll need to do to renew your certification. 
 
Be sure that you provide ample time to complete all the requirements before your certification expires. 
 
It's important to note that if your certification expires, you'll have to retake the certification exam, which is NOT free of charge.
