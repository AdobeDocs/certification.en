# Certification Journey - Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform

## Start Your Journey toward Certification

To earn certification, you need to pass 2 distinct exams with a proctor present, online or on-site, where available.

Purchase your exam voucher at Adobe Certification Voucher Center, if you have a discount, it will apply at checkout. Apply the voucher code when you schedule your exam.

If an exam is marked as retiring, you can still take it and your certification will be valid for two years from when you pass. We recommend taking the newer version, when possible, because it covers newer product capabilities.

If you have technical knowledge about audience segmentation, destination exports, and activation on real time basis for unified profiles that adhere to data and privacy regulations, customer data platforms (CDP) and knowledge of Adobe Experience Platform. 

This is the certification for YOU!

## Exam Purpose

An official Adobe Real-Time CDP Expert designation acknowledges your understanding of Adobe Experience Platform and Adobe Real-time Customer Data Platform, which is an application built on Adobe Experience Platform. This certification has 2 requirements.  To achieve this certification, you will need to pass both exams.

**Requirement 1: AD0-E600 Adobe Experience Platform Technical Foundations**

The AD0-E600 exam validates skills and knowledge covering the basic features and frequently performed tasks of Adobe Experience Platform at the Expert level.

**Requirement 2: AD7-E601 Adobe Real-Time CDP Technical Practitioner**

The AD7-E601 exam covers the creation, management and understanding of customer profile, segmentation, destinations across sources, and other topics. The exam validates the foundational skills and knowledge needed to employ Real-time CDP for audience segmentation, destination exports, and activation on a real-time basis for unified profiles that adhere to data and privacy regulations. Candidates should have experience with Customer Data Platforms (CDP) and knowledge of Adobe Experience Platform.
