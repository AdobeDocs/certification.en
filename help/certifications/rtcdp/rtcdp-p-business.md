You are not required to complete training before taking the exam, and training alone will not provide you with the knowledge and skills required to pass the exam. A combination of training and successful, on-the-job experience are critical to providing you with the repository needed to pass the exam.

Here are some suggested resources to help you prepare:

**Sample questions**

The sample questions allow you to see the type and format of items that you will encounter in the actual exam. There is no sign-on needed. The results of the sample questions are not stored, and do not predict your actual test results.

**Take the certification exam**

Adobe uses two vendors to administer proctored exams, PSI and Examity. 

* **PSI** offers test center and Japanese exam options (where available) 
* **[!DNL Examity]** offers a remote online option

To schedule, reschedule, or cancel your exam, simply click on the vendor of choice, and follow the instructions provided on screen. Itâ€™s that simple! 

Your profile name in the Adobe Credential Management System must exactly match your Government ID. Failure to have identical information or any mismatch will result in the proctor terminating the exam and will require you to reschedule your appointment in addition to paying an additional exam fee.

Cancellations and rescheduling are possible if initiated prior to 48 hours before the scheduled exam appointment. Candidates must modify this appointment themselves.
