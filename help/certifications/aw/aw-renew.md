# Renew your Adobe Workfront certification

We're happy to announce that you are now able to renew your certification via a new, no-cost format. It involves using on-demand Adobe Experience League courses and tutorialsâ€”simply complete three activities to renew your certification at no cost. You must renew before your certification expires, or you will need to take the full exam to become certified again.
